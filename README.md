# template
This repo was cloned from the FuTRES project. I will be updating it to match the UA-SRC-Data project.

To use these templates, first see the **templates.csv** for the terms, their definitions, and descriptions. Users looking to contribute data to the UA-SRC Data project can then download the template most appropriate for their data (**user-download-xx** for xx, **user-download-yy** for yy, or **user-download-zz** for zz). This provides a blank slate with the appropriate field names, making it easier to reformat your data for ingestion into FuTRES.

You can download the template file directly or clone the repo to your desktop and edit it locally.
