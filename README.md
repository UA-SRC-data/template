# template
To use these templates, first see the **templates.csv** for the terms, their definitions, and descriptions. Users looking to contribute data to the FuTRES project can then download the template most appropriate for their data (**user-download-neo** for neontological, **user-download-paleo** for paleontological, or **user-download-zooarch** for zooarchaeological). This provides a blank slate with the appropriate field names, making it easier to reformat your data for ingestion into FuTRES.

In the very near future, you will be able to create custom templates using GEOME (add link when that is ready).

You can download the template file directly or clone the repo to your desktop and edit it locally.
