ContextName,link to Open Context or other URI for arch context identifier - or plain descriptive if not described elsewhere,provenience AG3-4ab,suggested,zooarch,"Kitty says: if this is available then the below information is presumably not necessary, but it will be fairly rare, especially in the beginning, that a link is readily available and so the below is necessary; Kitty asks: should this be zooarchaeological context name, or should this actually be extended to be the specific context name for either paleo or zoo specimens? or is ""bed"" the specific location of recovery of the paleo specimen? I'm guessing there is a more specific identifier of the actual location of recovery of paleo specimens as well?"

CulturalStratigraphy: culture,various thesauri?  http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300017826 in the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus,Maya [http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300017826],suggested,zooarch,"Kitty says: my concern with all of these is that there is no central place to go for them - once datasets start coming in from all over the world, there will be various sources for URIs - these work for the area I research"
CulturalStratigraphy: occupation period (aka chronology),http://perio.do/en/,Late Classic [http://n2t.net/ark:/99152/p064v7m9xx2],suggested,zooarch,"Kitty says: in some ways this may seem to overlap with the chronometry above, but in many cases it is a looser term that approximates the occupational period of an area by a culture - whereas the chronometry is a specific date that relies on quantifiable data (at least that's my distinction)"
CulturalStratigraphy: local chronology,various thesauri?  http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300017826 in the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus,Tepeu [http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300017108],suggested,zooarch,"Kitty says: this is the more detailed version of the chronology above, and as with that one, is a generalized period name"
